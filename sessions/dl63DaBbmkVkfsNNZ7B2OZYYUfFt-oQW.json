Avoid leaning forward or tilting your head excessively downward.\n\n2. **Shoulder Position**: Relax your shoulders. Avoid hunching or raising them; they should be back and down, away from your ears.\n\n3. **Body Position**: Position yourself so that you are facing the procedure directly. If possible, maintain a stance that allows for comfortable arm movement without straining your neck.\n\n4. **Use a Chair or Stool**: If feasible, opt for a stool with good lumbar support to help you maintain proper posture and allow for better stability.  \n\n5. **Frequent Breaks**: Take short breaks when possible to shift your position, stretch, and relieve tension in your neck and shoulders.\n\n6. **Equipment Height**: Adjust the height of the equipment or your surgical table when possible, ensuring that it is at or slightly below elbow height to minimize strain.\n\n7. **Neck Support**: If standing for long periods, consider using a neck brace or support to remind you to maintain proper posture.\n\nIn addition to posture, remember to stay hydrated and engage in regular stretching exercises to keep your neck and shoulders flexible. If the discomfort persists, it might be worth consulting with a physical therapist for personalized advice. Let me know if you need more detailed exercises or other suggestions!"}],"__lastAccess":1742584037414}
