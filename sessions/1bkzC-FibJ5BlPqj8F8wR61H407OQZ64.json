Any suggestions?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Neck strain can be common with prolonged surgical procedures, but there are several stretches you can try to alleviate discomfort while at your workstation or in between surgeries:\n\n1. **Neck Tilts**: Sit up straight and gently tilt your head toward one shoulder, holding for 15-30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.\n\n2. **Chin Tucks**: Sit with your back straight and slowly tuck your chin toward your chest. Hold for a few seconds and release. This helps align your spine.\n\n3. **Shoulder Rolls**: Roll your shoulders forward in a circular motion 10 times, then backward. This can release tension in the neck and shoulders.\n\n4. **Upper Trapezius Stretch**: Sit or stand and grab the edge of your chair or a stable surface with one hand. With the other hand, gently tilt your head towards the opposite shoulder, feeling a stretch in the side of your neck.\n\n5. **Forward Bend**: Stand or sit and interlace your fingers behind your back, then gently lift your arms while bending forward at the hips to stretch the back and neck.\n\nMake sure to take breaks during surgeries when possible to move and stretch gently. Staying hydrated and adjusting your workstation ergonomics can also prevent strain. If the discomfort continues, consider consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. \n\nLet me know if you need more tips for workplace wellness!"}],"__lastAccess":1742582878138}
