It primarily involves issues with insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar (glucose) levels. There are several types of diabetes, but the most common are:\n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: This is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. People with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin daily to survive. It usually develops in children or young adults, but it can occur at any age.\n\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: This is the most common form of diabetes and is often associated with obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and poor diet. In Type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to insulin or the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. It can sometimes be managed with lifestyle changes, but many people eventually need medication or insulin.\n\n3. **Gestational Diabetes**: This condition occurs during pregnancy when the body cannot produce enough insulin to meet the extra demands of pregnancy. It typically resolves after giving birth, but it can increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\n**Symptoms** of diabetes can include increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing wounds. Long-term complications can affect various organ systems, leading to heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems.\n\n**Management** involves monitoring blood sugar levels, maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and sometimes insulin or other medications. Self-care and education are crucial in managing diabetes effectively and reducing the risk of complications.\n\nIf you have specific questions or need more detailed information about a certain aspect of diabetes, feel free to ask!"}],"__lastAccess":1741973031404}
