There are three main types of diabetes: \n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: This is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. People with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin for life to survive.\n\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: This type is more common and is often linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity, inactivity, and poor diet. In Type 2 diabetes, the body either becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin. It can be managed with lifestyle changes, oral medications, or insulin.\n\n3. **Gestational Diabetes**: This occurs during pregnancy when the body cannot produce enough insulin to support both the mother and growing baby. It usually resolves after childbirth, but it can increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\n### Symptoms:\nCommon symptoms of diabetes include:\n- Increased thirst\n- Frequent urination\n- Extreme hunger\n- Fatigue\n- Blurred vision\n- Slow healing of wounds\n- Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet\n- Unexplained weight loss\n\n### Complications:\nIf not managed properly, diabetes can lead to serious complications, including:\n- Heart disease\n- Kidney damage\n- Nerve damage\n- Eye problems (such as diabetic retinopathy)\n- Foot issues (including infections and gangrene)\n\n### Management:\nEffective management of diabetes involves:\n- Regular blood sugar monitoring\n- Adopting a healthy diet\n- Engaging in regular physical activity\n- Taking medications or insulin when necessary\n- Education on the disease and self-care practices to reduce the risk of complications\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of diabetes, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for evaluation and management."}],"__lastAccess":1741974611370}
