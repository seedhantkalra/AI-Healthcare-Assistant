Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar (glucose) levels in the body. There are two main types of diabetes:\n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: This is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Individuals with Type 1 diabetes require insulin therapy for survival.\n\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: This is the more common form, usually developed in adults, and is often associated with obesity. In Type 2 diabetes, the body develops insulin resistance, meaning that the insulin produced is not used effectively. Management usually includes lifestyle changes, oral medications, and sometimes insulin.\n\nCommon symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme fatigue, and blurred vision. Long-term complications from uncontrolled diabetes can lead to cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, kidney damage, eye problems, and foot issues.\n\nManagement of diabetes often involves monitoring blood sugar levels, maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and adhering to prescribed medications. If you need more specific information or have questions about management strategies, feel free to ask!"}],"__lastAccess":1742407040954}
