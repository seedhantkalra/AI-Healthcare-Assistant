It occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar) or when the body's cells become resistant to insulin's effects. There are three main types of diabetes:\n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: This is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It usually develops in children or young adults, hence is sometimes referred to as juvenile diabetes. People with Type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin therapy.\n\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: This is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for about 90-95% of all cases. It typically develops in adults but is increasingly being diagnosed in children and adolescents due to rising obesity rates. In Type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough insulin. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight, play a significant role in its management and prevention.\n\n3. **Gestational Diabetes**: This type develops during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\n### Symptoms of Diabetes\nCommon symptoms include:\n\n- Increased thirst and frequent urination\n- Extreme fatigue\n- Blurred vision\n- Slow-healing sores\n- Unexplained weight loss (more common in Type 1)\n- Increased hunger\n\n### Complications\nIf not managed effectively, diabetes can lead to serious complications, including:\n\n- Heart disease and stroke\n- Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy)\n- Eye damage (diabetic retinopathy)\n- Nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy)\n- Foot damage, which can lead to infections or amputations\n- Skin conditions\n\n### Management and Treatment\nManagement of diabetes involves:\n\n- **Monitoring blood sugar levels**: Regularly checking glucose levels helps manage and adjust treatment as needed.\n- **Medication**: Type 1 diabetics need insulin therapy, while Type 2 diabetics may manage their condition with lifestyle changes, oral medications, or insulin.\n- **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats is essential. Individuals should also monitor carbohydrate intake.\n- **Physical activity**: Regular exercise helps control weight, lowers blood sugar levels, and improves overall health.\n- **Education**: Understanding diabetes and its management is crucial for effective self-care.\n\n### Prevention\nWhile Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, Type 2 diabetes can often be delayed or prevented through lifestyle modifications, including maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and managing weight.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms or has concerns about diabetes, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and management."}],"__lastAccess":1741638265177}
