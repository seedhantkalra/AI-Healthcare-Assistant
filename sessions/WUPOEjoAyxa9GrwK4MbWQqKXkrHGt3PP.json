There are mainly two types of diabetes:\n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: This is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It typically develops in children and young adults, but it can occur at any age. People with Type 1 diabetes require insulin therapy for life.\n\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: This is more common and usually develops in adults. In Type 2 diabetes, the body either becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin. Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, genetics, and age. Management includes lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) and may require medication or insulin.\n\n**Management Strategies**: \n- Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels\n- Eating a balanced diet with controlled carbohydrate intake\n- Regular physical activity\n- Medication or insulin therapy as needed\n\n**Symptoms**: Common symptoms of diabetes can include excessive thirst, frequent urination, extreme fatigue, blurred vision, and slow healing wounds.\n\nPreventive measures for Type 2 diabetes include maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and eating a balanced diet. \n\nIf you have specific questions or need detailed information about diabetes management, feel free to ask!"}],"__lastAccess":1742575893494}
